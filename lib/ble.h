 * \section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * This document describes the libble API, a BLE library for Android which sits
 * on top of libhardware. The objective of this library is to abstract away
 * some libhardware specifics, exposing only what is necessary to create BLE
 * bindings to higher-level languages.
 *
 * Due to Bluedroid and/or libhardware architectural restrictions no more than
 * one process can access the Bluetooth resources on the system at the same
 * time. That means that only one program that makes use of libble can run on
 * the system at a certain time and that Bluetooth should be disabled in the
 * Android GUI (if running).
