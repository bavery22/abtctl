Known issues:
-------------

Bluedroid doesn't handle the bonded devices list very well. This means it may
fail to realize that the link already have the necessary security level and
try to re-authenticate a link that is already bonded when there is no need.
Also, it may fail to pair with a unbonded device because it thinks it is
already bonded (this have been noticed after removing the bond with a
previously bonded device). To force the removal of all bonded devices the
files /data/misc/bluedroid/bt_config.xml and
/data/misc/bluedroid/bt_config.old should be deleted.
